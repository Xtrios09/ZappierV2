# ZappierV2

A serverless, privacy-first messaging application that enables secure peer-to-peer communication without requiring servers, logins, or data collection.

***Demo here: https://zappierv2.onrender.com/***

## Overview

ZappierV2 is a prototype messaging platform built with privacy and sustainability at its core. The application provides end-to-end encrypted communication directly between devices, eliminating the need for central servers while maintaining functionality across geographical distances. Every interaction happens locally on your device, ensuring complete data ownership and privacy.

## Key Features

**Privacy and Security**
- Complete end-to-end encryption for all messages
- Zero server dependency for message transmission
- No user accounts, logins, or verification processes required
- No tracking cookies or analytics
- All data stored locally on your device with full user control

**Accessibility and Convenience**
- No application download required - works directly in the browser
- No file size limitations for shared content
- Unique device identification through generated codes and barcodes
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Functions across cities and geographical boundaries

**Sustainability**
- Serverless architecture reduces environmental impact
- Minimal infrastructure requirements
- No cloud storage dependencies

**User Experience**
- Clean interface with no advertisements
- Simple peer connection through unique device codes
- Direct device-to-device communication

## How It Works

Each device running ZappierV2 receives a unique identification code presented as both a text string and a scannable barcode. Users can connect with other users by exchanging these codes, establishing a direct encrypted communication channel between their devices. Messages are transmitted peer-to-peer without passing through any intermediary servers, and all message history remains stored locally on each participating device.

## Technology Architecture

The application leverages WebRTC technology for peer-to-peer connections, enabling direct communication between browsers without server mediation. Encryption protocols ensure that messages remain secure during transmission, while local storage mechanisms maintain message history on individual devices.

## Current Status

ZappierV2 is currently in the prototype phase. While the core functionality has been successfully demonstrated and tested across various scenarios including cross-city communication, significant development work remains before the application can be released to the general market. Ongoing efforts focus on performance optimization, user interface refinement, edge case handling, and comprehensive testing across different network conditions and device configurations.

## Development Roadmap

**Immediate Priorities**
- Performance optimization for various network conditions
- Enhanced error handling and connection stability
- User interface improvements and user experience testing
- Comprehensive security auditing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Future Enhancements**
- Group messaging capabilities
- File transfer optimization
- Message delivery confirmation mechanisms
- Offline message queuing
- Enhanced barcode scanning functionality

## Installation and Setup

*(Development instructions will be added as the project progresses)*

## Usage

*(User guide will be provided upon release)*

## Privacy Statement

ZappierV2 operates on the principle of zero-knowledge architecture. The application developers and operators have no access to user messages, connection data, or personal information. All communication occurs directly between users' devices, and no data is collected, transmitted to, or stored on external servers.

## Contributing

This project is currently in active development. Contribution guidelines will be established as the project approaches public release.

## Technical Requirements

*(Browser compatibility and device requirements will be documented)*

## Known Limitations

As a prototype application, ZappierV2 currently has several limitations that are being addressed during ongoing development. Network conditions may affect connection stability, and certain edge cases require additional handling. Users should be aware that this is experimental software and should not be relied upon for critical communications.
